## Why is this a blog post??

I kinda just wanted to share it and I need to pad my blog posts.

### Why a fall playlist?

It was just kinda a vibe that is overlooked.

### Sigh, where can I listen to it?

<Spotify url="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0xS2jrnIxM57GWWg4co7Ov" />

### Songs You NEED to hear in this playlist:

#### #18 Chinese Translation

New song for me. This song just rocks. I would love to hear about what you take the song to mean.

#### #1 Maple Treeway cover

I love the addition of violins to this song. It also inspired me to create this playlist.

#### #22 Library Magic

It starts a bit slow but is really meaningful.

#### #21 Glistened By the Wind

Amazing instrumental that just feels like fall.

#### #19 Stop this Train

There is a ton of songs that go over this feeling but I particularly feel this one does a good job of resolving it in the end.

#### #16 A Foggy Day

Its not anything amaizing but Louis Armstrong is just fantastic.

##### I could talk about every song in this playlist but I am not going to. If you have any questions or suggestions I would very much enjoy an email at titus.maunu@gmail.com
