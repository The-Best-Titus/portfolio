## Why did I want a website?

I love working and learning, thats why I own my own server that I host apps on. Now that I am a student I wanted an online portfolio to show off my work in cool way. At some point I would like to create my own website from scratch, but this is my first time working with websites, html, javascript, and markdown so that is a future project.

### Why Astro?

I did my resurch and was debating using 11ty, hugo, and Astro. I ended up landing on Astro because I hope to someday expand my website to do more things and Astro is something that will support that.

### Why use a Template?

While I have experiance with C and Python I have almost never worked with any web based coding laugage so to save me some headache I used a template, bloomfolio to make this initial site easier.

### You used AI!?

Yes, ai is a powerfull tool to help me. I want to eventully know how to do all this on my own, but as a full time student I just don't have time to spend on learning the ins and outs of this system. I am hoping that I will become somewhat literate by asmosis in time.

###### _Copilot vs Cluade_

In this project I started with using CoPilot to help me. While it was initally helpfull it struggled when I wanted to create my own theme. It really wanted to go about making a theme a certain way that wasn't how the site was setup. Looking through the files I found the developer of this template made a file to help Cluade better understand how the site worked, so I decided to see how it would fare and after quite a few hours I finnally got the theme to work.

## Themeing

Like I mentioned Earilier I wanted a theme to personalize my website. So I used a site called [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to create a pallet that I would integrate into my site. Then using Cluade I integrated it into my site and limited the themes to only light and dark.
